# Webkiosk
Webkiosk app has a seamless and simple user-interface which has revolutionised the way you people look  at their attendance and college schedule.
Seeing its huge popularity and  due to my lack of adequate free time I've decided to open source it.


Looking forward for great contributions from you people, afterall it's app for your own college, use your imagination,
implement great features and we'll surely integerate your contributions  to official app if it is useful for everyone.


#Would be great if someone could do these
* Predicting attendance if you miss certain number of class.
* Tracking library penalty amount for late book submission.
* Timetable for JIIT-128,JUIT,JUET.
* Way timetable is fetched from server and handled in app(it's quite non-intutive right now).
* Help in documenting undocumented sections of app mentioned below.
* Anyting you could imagine.

#Undocumented sections of app
* Webkoisk website crawler
* Timetable fetch protocol(It's serverd from google drive in .txt format. Need help from someone who can help me in documenting it.)
* Notifications
* Database auto refresher
