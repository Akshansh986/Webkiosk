# Webkiosk
Webkiosk app has a seamless and simple user-interface which has revolutionized the way students look at their attendance, timetable etc.
Seeing its huge popularity, my lack of adequate free time and to encourage further development of app I've decided to open source it.

Looking forward for great contributions from you people, after all its app for your own college, use your imagination,
Implement great features and we'll surely integrate your contributions to official app if it is useful for everyone.


#Would be great if someone could implement these
* Updating app to Android Marshmallow
* Predicting attendance if you miss certain number of class
* Tracking library penalty amount for late book submission
* Timetable for JIIT-128,JUIT,JUET
* App for iOS
* Anything you could imagine


#Undocumented sections of app
* Webkiosk website crawler
* Timetable fetch protocol (It's served from Google drive in .txt format. Need help from someone who can help me in documenting it)
* Notifications
* Database auto refresher


#Need help
Contact ASAP if you can help me in any of these

* Documenting timetable fetch protocol
* Documenting undocumented sections of app
* Open sourcing timetable extractor (one that extract timetable from excel sheet provided by college)


#Notes
* Words "AvgAtnd" and "AtndOverivew" in used interchangeably in whole project (you'll understand it after reading code)
* Do let me know if you are finding any difficulty in reading code or are unclear about any section of code.
